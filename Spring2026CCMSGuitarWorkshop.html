      <h2>Guitar Workshop - March 14, 2026 - Calmar Program Centre - 10am-2pm</h2>
      <p><strong>Learn to play guitar!</strong>
<p>This workshop is designed for absolute beginner to intermediate guitar players.
<p><strong>What is this?</strong>
<p>This workshop is a friendly introduction to playing the guitar. Over the day, we will learn to chord and strum some songs giving you a great start on the instrument! Or, if you can already play a bit, you will get lots of practice ahead of summer campfire season. We will learn to read chord diagrams and song charts so you can take what you learn home with you and continue your learning beyond the workshop.
<p><strong>What music will we play?</strong>
<p>We will play a variety of music, from folk, to country, to popular songs. The music is selected to be recognizable to most people, and for its educational value. You will receive a small songbook of music with your registration.
<p><b>Who will be my teacher?</b>
<p>This workshop is led by <strong>Logan Mills</strong>. Logan grew up in Calmar, and continues to live and work in the community. He has been playing guitar for twenty years and teaching guitar for fifteen. He holds a Bachelor of Music from the University of Toronto, and he is excellent around a campfire. 
<p><strong>Who can come?</strong>
<p>This workshop is inclusive of everybody age 8+. This workshop is capped at 15 participants.
<p><strong>What do I need to bring?</strong>
<p>Just a guitar, and your own lunch!
<p><strong>I have always wanted to play guitar, but I don’t have one!</strong>
<p>You are in luck! We have a few instruments available for use during the workshop. We can also point you in the direction of a music instrument lending library in Leduc. If you need help finding an instrument, reach out and we would be glad to assist.
